# GANInversion_with_ConsecutiveImgs
Official code for our ICCV paper: "From Continuity to Editability: Inverting GANs with Consecutive Images" https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.13812.pdf

**1**. Build the environment with stylegan.yaml (Anaconda uis required) \
**2**. Compile FlowNet2 dependencies (correlation, resample, and channel norm layers) \
**3**. Download the StyleGAN weight and FlowNet weight from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g2gp4tR0wAc6uG24qkt82pM3afD-vfBT/view?usp=sharing. \
**4**. Python main.py
